            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, Cloud Company began as a small startup with a vision to revolutionize the way businesses manage their data. Our founders, a group of passionate tech enthusiasts, recognized the growing need for scalable and secure cloud solutions in an increasingly digital world. With a commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, 
                we set out to provide businesses of all sizes with the tools they need to thrive in the cloud.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2010 - The Beginning 
                    In our early days, we focused on developing a robust cloud storage platform that allowed users to store and 
                    access their data from anywhere in the world.
                    Our first product, Cloud Storage Pro, quickly gained traction among small businesses 
                    looking for reliable and cost-effective data management solutions.</li>
                <li>2012 - Expanding Our Services
                        As our customer base grew, so did our offerings. In 2012, we launched Cloud Compute, 
                        a powerful Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution that enabled businesses to deploy virtual servers and applications with ease.
                        This expansion marked a significant milestone in our journey, allowing us to cater to a wider range of industries and use cases.
                </li>
                <li>2015 - A Commitment to Security
                        With the rise of cyber threats, we recognized the importance of data security. In 2015,
                        we invested heavily in enhancing our security protocols and compliance measures. We
                        became one of the first cloud providers to achieve ISO 27001 certification,
                        demonstrating our commitment to safeguarding our customers' data.
                </li>
                
                <li>2018 - Global Reach
                    By 2018, Cloud Company had established data centers in multiple regions around the
                    world, allowing us to offer low-latency services to our global clientele. Our commitment
                    to providing exceptional service led to partnerships with major enterprises, further
                    solidifying our position in the cloud computing market.
                </li>
                    
                <li>2020 - Innovation and Growth
                    The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation for many businesses,
                    and Cloud Company was ready to meet the demand. We introduced new features such
                    as remote collaboration tools and enhanced analytics capabilities, empowering our
                    customers to adapt to the changing landscape.
                </li>

                <li>2023 - Looking Ahead
                    Today, Cloud Company is a leader in the cloud computing industry, serving thousands
                    of clients across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education. Our
                    mission remains the same: to provide innovative, secure, and scalable cloud solutions
                    that empower businesses to succeed.

                    As we look to the future, we are committed to continuous improvement and innovation.
                    We are excited to explore new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine
                    learning, to further enhance our offerings and provide even greater value to our
                    customers.
                </li>
